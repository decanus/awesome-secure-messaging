- [Bramble Transport Protocol](https://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar-spec/blob/master/protocols/BTP.md) - transport layer security protocol for delay-tolerant networks, provides secure channel between two endpoints

- [Bramble Synchronisation Protocol](https://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar-spec/blob/master/protocols/BSP.md) - data synchronisation protocol for delay-tolerant networks

## Trust establishment
- [X3DH](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/x3dh/) - two-party asynchronous key agreement protocol

- [Bramble QR Code Protocol](https://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar-spec/blob/master/protocols/BQP.md) - in-person key agreement protocol to establish a shared secret

## Anonymity

- [The Differences Between Onion Routing and Mix Networks](https://crypto.is/blog/mix_and_onion_networks) - brief comparison

- [Anonymity Trilemma: Strong Anonymity, Low Bandwidth Overhead, Low Latencyâ€”Choose Two](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/954.pdf) - on fundamental tradeoff for anonymous communication protocols

- [Selected Papers in Anonymity](https://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/) - meta-list of selected papers in anonymity since 1977

- [Sphinx Mix Network Cryptographic Packet Format Specification](https://katzenpost.mixnetworks.org/docs/specs/sphinx.html) - specification for Sphinx mix network packet format

## Censorship Resistance

- [Pluggable Transport](https://www.pluggabletransports.info/) - specification initiative to allow applications being used as transports to make network traffic harder to distinguish and block, origins in Tor

## Applications

- [Briar](https://briarproject.org/) - messaging app employing several censorship-resitance techniques, like direct device-to-device comms (bluetooth, wifi), Tor routing

- [Signal](https://signal.org/) - widely used security-based messaging app with intermediate server and phone based registration, includes voice calls
